### Hello and welcome to my github page.

My name is Will and I am a programmer doing _web stuff_ professionally.

I have a side project, code-named VCVRVR, where I am doing fun stuff with *virtual reality* and *modular synthesizers* in C++ for a change of pace. I talk about it on my blog: [blog.gotno.net/vcrvrvr](https://blog.gotno.net/vcvrvr). The relevant repositories are the [unreal engine application](https://github.com/gotno/osc3) and the [VCV Rack plugin](https://github.com/gotno/gtnosft).
